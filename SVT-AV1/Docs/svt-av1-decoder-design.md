## Introduction

This document describes the Intel SVT-AV1 decoder design. In particular, the decoder block diagram and multi-threading aspects are described. Besides, the document contains brief descriptions of the SVT-AV1 decoder modules such as parse, reconstruction, etc. This document is meant to be an accompanying document to the &quot;C Model&quot; source code, which contains the more specific details of the inner working of the decoder.

## High-level decoder architecture

The high-level decoder pipeline is shown in Figure 1. Further details on individual stages are given in subsequent sections. The multi-threading aspect of the decoder is also explained in detail in a separate section. The details of high-level data structures and frame buffers used in the decoder are also covered briefly later.

The major modules of the SVT-AV1 decoder are:

1. Parse
2. Reconstruction
3. Loop filter
4. CDEF
5. Loop Restoration

### Bit-Stream Parse

The Parse stage does all tasks related to OBU reading, arithmetic decoding and related mv prediction (such as find\_warp\_samples, etc.) that produce the necessary mode info and residual data info.

The header level parsing of sequence parameters and frame parameters happens separately via read\_sequence\_header\_obu andread\_frame\_header\_obufunctions. Parse Tile module does the parsing of tile group obu data. Figure 2 shows a typical flow of the parse stage.

**Input** : Bitstream buffer

**Output** : ModeInfo buffer, TransformInfo buffer, Coeff buffer
   Picture buffer with predicted values filled for blocks with palette mode
   Reconstructed picture buffer without applying post-processing filters for single-thread mode

![image2](./img/decoder_parse_stage.png)
<a name = "figure-2"></a>
##### Figure 2: Parse stage Flow

parse\_frame\_tiles() is the function that will trigger the parsing module in SVT-AV1 decoder. Parsing for each tile will be called by start\_parse\_tile(). Then parsing happen for each superblock in a tile by calling the function parse\_super\_block().

Note: The prediction for palette mode happens during the Parse stage itself.

### Reconstruction

This stage performs prediction, coefficient inverse scan, residual inverse quantization, inverse transform and finally generated the reconstructed data without applying post-processing filters. Figure 3 shows a typical flow of the reconstruction stage.

**Input** : ModeInfo buffer, TransformInfo buffer, Coeff buffer

**Output** : Reconstructed picture buffer without applying the post-processing filters.

![image3](./img/decoder_reconstruction_stage.png)
<a name = "figure-3"></a>
##### Figure 3: Reconstruction stage Flowdecode\_frame\_tiles() function starts reconstruction at frame level. Then decode\_tile\_job()  is called for each tile.

For each Superblock in a tile, decode\_super\_block() function will be called.

The total number of blocks inside a superblock and their corresponding **mode\_info** structure are stored while parsing. This helps to avoid calling of decode\_block() function recursively.

Note: The prediction for palette mode happens during the Parse stage itself.

Note: In single thread mode, decode\_super\_block() will be called immediately after every parse\_super\_block() for better cache efficiency. In this mode decode\_frame\_tiles() will be completely avoided.

### Loop Filter

The loop filter function is to eliminate (or at least reduce) visually objectionable artifacts associated with the semi-independence of the coding of super blocks and their constituent sub-blocks as per section 7.14 of AV1 spec. This stage applies the loop filter for the entire frame. Flow diagram for Loop Filter is below in Figure 4.

![image4](./img/decoder_loop_filter_stage.png)

##### Figure 4: Loop Filter stage Flow

**Input** : Reconstructed picture buffer

**Output** : Loop Filtered frame.

1. eb\_av1\_loop\_filter\_frame\_init() Initialization of loop filter parameters is performed  here.
2. Dec\_loop\_filter\_sb()

    * Loop through each block in SB.
      + Loop through each TUs in a block.
        1. Calculate the LF params.
        2. Apply LF for each vertical TU edge.
  2. Then applydec\_av1\_filter\_block\_plane\_horz().
    * Loop through each block in SB.
      + Loop through each TUs in a block.
        1. Calculate the LF params.
        2. Apply LF for each horizontal  TU edge.

##### Figure 6: LF Horizontal Stage

### CDEF

The CDEF performs deringing based on the detected direction of blocks as per section 7.15 of AV1 spec. This stage applies the CDEF for the entire frame. The flow diagram for the CDEF is shown in Figure 7.

![image7](./img/decoder_cdef_stage.png)
<a name = "figure-7"></a>
##### Figure 7: CDEF stage Flow

**Input:** Output of Loop filtered buffer.

**Output** : CDEF filtered buffer.

Steps involved in CDEF:

1. svt\_cdef\_frame()function will be called to start CDEF for a frame.
2.  For each 64x64 superblock function svt\_cdef\_block()will be called.
  1. The number of non-skip 8x8 blocks calculated.
  2. Store the 3-pixel rows of next SB&#39;s in line and column buffer to do CDEF in original pixels.
  3. Call eb\_cdef\_filter\_fb()  for each 8x8 non-skip block
    * Find the direction of each 8x8 block.
    * Filter the 8x8 block according to the identified direction- eb\_cdef\_filter\_block\_c().
    * Store the results in the destination buffer

##### Figure 8: CDEF Filter Flow

### Loop Restoration

This stage applies the Loop Restoration for the entire frame and the process is defined as per section 7.17 of AV1 spec. The flow diagram for the LR is shown in Figure 9.

![image9](./img/decoder_loop_restoration_stage.png)
<a name = "figure-9"></a>
##### Figure 9: Loop Restoration stage Flow

**Input** : CDEF filtered reconstructed buffer

**Output** : LR filtered reconstructed buffer

Loop Restoration for a frame starts from the function dec\_av1\_loop\_restoration\_filter\_frame ().

The steps involved are:

1. Call dec\_av1\_loop\_restoration\_filter\_row() for each row of height sb\_size.
  * call eb\_dec\_av1\_loop\_restoration\_filter\_unit()  for each LR unit of size 64x64
    1. Use the  stored CDEF/ LF above/below boundaries form neighbor block based on processing row is outer or inner row respectively by calling the function setup\_processing\_stripe\_boundary() .
    2. Apply the LR filter (stripe\_filter) based on the type of unit\_lrtype.
    3. Restore the LR filtered data back to stripe\_buffer by function restore\_processing\_stripe\_boundary().

## Multi-Threaded Architecture

Parallelism in the decoder could be achieved at multiple levels. Each thread could, for example, be performing a different task in the decoding pipeline. The decoder will use tile level parallelism for tile parsing jobs. Decoder reconstruction jobs will use tile row-level parallelism, whereas all the post-processing filter jobs will use frame row-level parallelism.

Let **N** be the number of threads configured for the decoder. The decoder library created **(N-1)** threads, which are called **worker threads**. The application thread which calls the decode process is called in the **main thread**. Together the decoder will have **N** working threads.

The main thread will perform the following inside the decoder:

1. **Parse** all OBUs completely other than OBU\_TILE\_GROUP
2. Do **MV Projection** Frame Row job if anything is pending
  - Wait till all threads have finished the stage
3. **Parse** Tile data if any tile parsing is pending
4. Do **Reconstruct** Tile Row job if anything is pending
5. Do **Loop Filter** Frame Row job if anything is pending
6. Do **CDEF** Frame Row job if anything is pending
  - If upscale is enabled, wait till all threads have finished the stage
7. Do **LR** Frame Row job if anything is pending
  - Wait till all threads have finished the stage
8. Return the control back to the caller (application)

Figure 10 shows the flow chart of the main thread.

The worker thread will perform the following:

1. Wait for the start frame processing flag
2. Do **MV Projection** Frame Row job if anything is pending
  - Wait till all threads have finished the stage
3. **Parse** Tile data if any tile parsing is pending
4. Do **Reconstruct** Tile Row job if anything is pending
5. Do **Loop Filter** Frame Row job if anything is pending
6. Do **CDEF** Frame Row job if anything is pending
  - If upscale is enabled, wait till all threads have finished the stage
7. Do **LR** Frame Row job if anything is pending
  - Wait till all threads have finished the stage

Figure 11 shows the flow chart of the worker thread.

### Tile level Parallelism

The decoder will use tile level parallelism for tile parsing jobs. Let **T** be the number of tiles present in Frame\_i and let **L** be the number of threads working on this frame. Each thread will try to pick up a tile parsing job and execute it as shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 below.

Please note that the thread number and tile number need not match. Each thread can pick any tile based on job availability. The pictures are just for understanding purpose only.

![image13](./img/decoder_tile_parallel_l_lt_t.png)
<a name = "figure-13"></a>
##### Figure 13: Tile Parallelism (L > T)

### Tile Row-level Parallelism

Decoder reconstruction uses tile row-level parallelism. Wavefront Processing (WPP) will be used to handle data dependencies. Figure 14 shows 9 threads reconstructing 4 Tiles in Frame\_i with Tile Row-level parallelism. Each thread picks a Tile row MT job and works in a WPP manner.

Each thread will try to pick a unique tile that has not yet processed any row and continues to pick the tile-row jobs from the same tile until no more jobs are present in the same tile. If all the jobs in current tile are picked, it switches to the new tile with maximum number of jobs to be processed. If a unique tile that has not yet processed any row is not found, it picks the tile with maximum number of jobs to be processed.

##### Figure 14: Illustration for Tile Row MT for 4 Tiles and 9 Threads

### Frame Row-level Parallelism

All the post-processing filter jobs will use frame row-level parallelism. Wavefront Processing (WPP) will be used to handle data dependencies if required. LF, CDEF, and LR may work with different unit sizes depending on the available parallelism unit instead of SB.

![image15](./img/decoder_5_threads.png)
<a name = "figure-15"></a>
##### Figure 15: Frame\_i with 5 Threads

Figure 15 shows 5 threads applying post-processing filters on Frame\_i. Each thread picks a Frame row MT job and works in a WPP manner.

### Job Selection and Sync Points in MT

The job selection is controlled using shared memory and mutex. DecMtRowInfo (for Parse Tile, Recon Tile, CDEF Frame, LR Frame), DecMtMotionProjInfo (for Motion Projection), DecMtParseReconTileInfo (for Frame Recon) and DecMtlfFrameInfo (for LF Frame) data structures hold these memory for job selection.

The sync points are controlled using shared memory and mutex. The following are the shared memory used for various syncs inside the decoder stages, like top-right sync.

1. sb\_recon\_row\_parsed: Array to store SB Recon rows in the Tile that have completed the parsing. This will be used for sb decode row start processing. It will be updated after the parsing of each SB row in a tile finished. If the value of this variable is set, the recon of an SB row starts. This check is done before decoding of an SB row in a tile starts inside decode\_tile().
2. sb\_recon\_completed\_in\_row: Array to store SBs completed in every SB row of Recon stage. Used for top-right sync. It will be updated with number of SBs being reconstructed after a recon of SB finished. If recon of &#39;Top SB&#39; and &#39;top right SB&#39; is done in the previous row, then only decoding of current SB starts. This check is done before the decoding of SB starts inside the function decode\_tile\_row().
3. sb\_recon\_row\_map: This map is used to store whether the recon of SB row of a tile is finished. Its value is updated after recon of a tile row is done inside decode\_tile() function.  If the recon of &#39;top, top right, current and bottom  SB row&#39; is done, then only LF  of current row starts. This check is done before starting LF inside the function dec\_av1\_loop\_filter\_frame\_mt().
4. lf\_row\_map: This is an array variable of  SB rows to store whether the LF of the current row is done or not. It will be set after the LF of the current row is done. If the LF of the current and next row is done, then only we start CDEF of the current row. This check is done before CDEF of current row starts inside the function svt\_cdef\_frame\_mt().
5. cdef\_completed\_for\_row\_map: Array to store whether CDEF of the current row is done or not. It will be set after the CDEF of the current row is done. If the CDEF of current is done, then only we start LR of the current row. This check is done before LR of current row starts inside the function dec\_av1\_loop\_restoration\_filter\_frame\_mt().
6. Hard-Syncs: The Following are the points where hard syncs, where all threads wait for the completion of the particular stage before going to the next stage, are happening in the decoder.
  1. Hard Sync after **MV Projection**. svt\_setup\_motion\_field() is the function where this hard-sync happens.
  2. Hard Sync after **CDEF** only when the upscaling flag is present. svt\_cdef\_frame\_mt() is the function where this hard-sync happens.
  3. Hard Sync after **LR**. Function where this hard-sync happens is dec\_av1\_loop\_restoration\_filter\_frame\_mt().

## Frame Level Buffers

The following are some important buffers used in the decoder.

| **Structure Description** | **Granularity** |
| --- | --- |
| BlockModeInfo | 4x4 |
| SB info | SB |
| TransformInfo | 4x4 |
| Coeff | 4x4 |
| Delta Q &amp; Delta LF Params | SB |
| cdef\_strength | 64x64 |
| p\_mi\_offset | 4x4 |

Table 1 Important Frame level buffers

### BlockModeInfo

This buffer contains block info required for **Recon**. It is allocated for worst-case every 4x4 block for the entire frame.

Even though the buffer is allocated for every 4x4 in the frame, the structure is not replicated for every 4x4 block. Instead, each block has associated with only one structure even if the block size is more than 4x4. A map with an offset from the start is used for neighbor access purposes. This reduced the need for replication of data structure and better cache efficient usage.

Figure 15 shows a sample superblock split to multiple blocks, numbered from 0 to 18. So 19 BlockModeInfo structures are **continuously populated** from SB start location, corresponding to each block (Instead of replicating the structures for all the 1024 4x4 blocks).  Assume this is the first SB in the picture, then Figure 16 shows the map with offset for each location in the SB and stored in p\_mi\_offset buffer. This map will be used for deriving neighbor BlockModeInfo structure at any location if needed.

### SB info

This buffer stores SB related data. It is allocated for each SB for the entire frame.

### TransformInfo

Transform info of a TU unit is stored in this buffer. It is allocated for each TU unit, the worst case for each 4x4 in a frame.

### Coeff

This buffer contains coeff of each mi\_unit (4x4). Each mi\_unit contains 16 coeffs. For ST, it is allocated for each 4x4 unit for an SB, whereas for MT it is at each 4x4 for the entire frame.

### delta\_q

 This buffer is used to store delat\_q params and is allocated at the SB level for the entire frame.

### Delta\_lf

This buffer is allocated at the SB level for the entire frame.

### cdef\_strength

This is allocated at the 64x64 level for the entire frame.
