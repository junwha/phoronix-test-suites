# Use following format to define a test vector
#
# file_name Y4M? color_format w h bit_depth compressed_10bit_output start_frame frame_count
#
# Lines start with # will be ignored.
# File must saved in same folder with config file.
# color_format support 420, 420p10 in current version.
# If 'compressed_10bit_output' set on with a 420p10 color format input file, test app will feed video frame into encoder with compressed 10 bit format.
# start_frame and frame_count will set test range of a input file.
# With 'frame_count = 0', will use all following frames start from 'start_frame'.
# start_frame use 0 as first frame index.
