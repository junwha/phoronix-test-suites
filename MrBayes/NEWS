Release Note

Development version  (not yet released)
  * Move to semantic versioning scheme (see https://semver.org/).
    Release numbers are MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where a new MAJOR release
    number means backward incompatible changes were made, a new MINOR
    number means backward compatible features were added, and a new
    PATCH number means backward compatible bugfixes to the C code were
    made.  We may or may not use transient suffixes like "a", "b",
    "-alpha", "-beta" and "-rcN" as well at times.
  * Use latexmk to build the PDF documentation, if avaliable.
  * Bug fix to multi-partition Beagle code.

v3.2.7a (Mar 06 2019): hotfix
  * PDF manual re-generated from already updated LaTeX sources.

v3.2.7 (Feb 13 2019)
  * Added lognormal and flat ordered dirichelet distributions as
    alternatives to the gamma prior on site variation across sites.
  * Added new, optional moves for the fossilized birth-death model.
  * Added new, optional parsimony-guided moves for non-clock trees.
  * Support for Beagle 3 added.
  * Added support for FMA and AVX instructions in built-in likelihood
    calculators for 4by4 nucleotide models.

  * Fix pdf in the coalescent prior.
  * Fix a few issues when appending to the previous run.
  * Improve the efficiency of moving ancestral fossils.
  * Add lognormal rate variation among sites [lset rate=lnorm].
  * Add parsimony-biased SPR and TBR proposals (for developers).
  * Other minor bug fixes and improvements.

v3.2.4 (Jan 27 2015)
  * Correct the proposal ratio in the node slider move for non-clock tree.
