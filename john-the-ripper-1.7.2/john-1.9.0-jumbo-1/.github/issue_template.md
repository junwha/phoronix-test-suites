### IMPORTANT ###
This is not a support forum, it's a bug tracker. If you don't understand the difference, please do NOT open an issue. For questions and support, review recent postings on the john-users mailing list at https://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/ and then subscribe to the list at https://www.openwall.com/john/#lists and post your message to the list by e-mailing `john-users at lists.openwall.com`.

We are not interested in bugs in your distro-supplied and/or several years old Jumbo. Please do not open an issue unless you tried the latest version from HERE first.

### Steps to reproduce ###
Try to be clear about your environment and what you are doing. If possible, share a sample hash or file that can be used to reproduce.

### System configuration ###
Attach details about your OS and about JtR, including:
- `$ ./john --list=build-info`.
- `$ ./john --list=opencl-devices` (if applicable).
