### KeyDB DEB Package Source Builds

This directory contains scripts and components needed to generate debian packages on different distributions/architectures from source

The 'debian' directory contains debian source code for bionic, buster and later distributions as it uses functions only available with debhelper11+. 'debian_dh9' is used for xenial, stretch and earlier distributions using debhelper9.

You will need to install pbuilder `sudo apt install pbuilder` along with other distribution specific dependancies

Generate deb packages with the following script command run from this directory:

```
$ ./deb-buildsource.sh
```

This generates a directory structure, .dsc file, original.tar.gz, and new changelog for the distribution and architecture installed.

When complete the produced debian packages will be located in deb_files_generated directory.

Arguments for the deb-buildsource.sh script that can be passed are either 'None' or '"your custom comments"'. 'None' assumes a permanent changelog entry has been made listing the correct build for the version. If you quote and enter your own comment string, it will be appended to the changelog for that deb package. If no argument is passed a default comment is generated saying that this deb package was generated by this script.

This script has been tested on xenial/bionic/stretch/buster
